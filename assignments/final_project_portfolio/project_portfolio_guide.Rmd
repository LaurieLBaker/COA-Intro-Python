# Creating your Final Project

The goal of the final project is to synthesize concepts covered in the lectures, homeworks, and labs. It will consist of:

| Components     |  Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| A presentation | A short video presentation (3 minutes long) introducing the script you wrote and what it does. | 
| The code | A well documented script using the concepts we have learned in class so far. |
| Summary | A summary of how the concepts are used. |

Your final project is due on **Friday, March 17**. We will show the final videos in class.

## Project Components {.tabset}


### Presentation

Your presentation should be no more than 3 minutes and should introduce:

1. **Background**: When/why would you use the script?
2. **Purpose**: What does it do?
3. **Mechanics**: How does it work?

Presentations may be recorded as a video file and posted on google classroom. A zoom recording of a slideshow is fine.


### The Code

There will be time slots to discuss and propose your project idea in class. 

**Concepts covered**

Your code must implement each of the concepts used in class in the table below and **at least two** of the algorithms we have covered in class. 

| Concepts     | 
| ----------- |
| Data Types and Strings |  
|Variables, assignment statements & expressions |
|Functions (at least three total): these can be fruitful or non-fruitful|  
|For Loops| 
| Algorithms* |  
| Control Flow (one of: if, if else, elif, while)  |  


*Including: 1. Count something, 2. Add numbers, 3. Build a string/list, 4. Find an item in a list, 5. Find the minimum value in a list

Your script will be evaluated on the concepts we have used so far in class including good practices in writing code:

**Program Inspection**

Does the program use good practices in writing code?

* Good names for variables and parameters
* Uses appropriate type hinting for function parameters and return types
* Appropriate function comments, including brief function description,
        and descriptions for arguments and return types
* Good inline commenting throughout
* Appropriate use of white-space (spaces around operators, blank lines)
* At least two tests per function called in main()

### Summary of how concepts are used

1. A paragraph (~250 words) that explains how the concepts are used within your code, with the particular sections of code where the concept is used referenced. 

## Deadline and submitting your final project

Your Final Project is due on Friday, March 17.

* The submission will be in three parts:
   - You will post your presentation video on google classroom
   - You will submit your final project code as a `.ipynb` file including your summary of how the concepts are used in a text code chunk.
   - Comment on at least two other student's projects.
