# Creating your Portfolio

- As a final culminating project, you will be building a repository throughout the
semester to help you learn the course concepts while also reflecting on your
understanding.

- As part of this repository, you will be asked to include well-documented examples of
your completed work that address a particular concept, and to provide guided
reflections on that concept and on your work.

- You will also be asked to include a few reflections on investigations of real-world
contexts (e.g., rank-choice voting, bias in algorithms).

The goal of the final portfolio is to synthesize concepts covered in the lectures, homeworks, labs, and project and create a showcase of your work.

## Contents

Each section will include:

1.  **Zines** a zine that explains concepts in a simple way.
2. **Documented example of work**: well-documented examples of
your completed work that address a particular concept, and reflections on that concept and on your work including any revisions based on feedback.
3. **Real world reflection**: that shows how a concept connects to the real-world. 

The final portfolio will consist of the following themes:

| Theme     | Description | 
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| Data Types and Strings | zine; documented example (e.g. hw1.py) |
|Variables, assignment statements & expressions | zine; documented example|
|Functions (fruitful, non-frutiful)| zine; documented example| 
|For Loops| zine; documented example| 
| Algorithms  (1. Count something, 2. Add numbers, 3. Build a string, 4. Build a list)| zine ; documented example| 
| Control Flow (if, if else, elif, while)  | zine; documented example (e.g. proj 1); real-world reflection (EdStem: Rank Choice Voting)| 

## Zines {.tabset}


>"A zine is a small-circulation self-published work of original or appropriated texts and images, usually reproduced via a copy machine." ~ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine)

Zines should set out to answer:

1. What do people need to know about a topic? 
2. What are the most important things?
3. What did you found surprising when learning this topic?

As you write your zine you should think about how you would write a clear explanation to describe it to someone new?

Let's look at a few examples by Julia Evans of [wizardzines.org](https://wizardzines.com/)

### Example 1

```{r zine-example, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 2, fig.fullwidth = TRUE, fig.cap = "Asking Good Questions Zine Example by [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/).", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/asking_questions_zine_julia_evans.svg")
```


### Example 2


```{r bash-tricks-zine, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 2, fig.fullwidth = TRUE, fig.cap = "BASH tricks zine example by [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/).", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/bash_tricks.png")
```


### How to create a zine

## A documented sample

Your documented sample should consist of:

1. A homework, lab, or project
2. A short introduction (3-4 sentences) pointing out how it illustrates the concept, with the particular sections of code where the concept is used referenced. 
3. A short bulleted reflection pointing out any changes made from feedback (e.g. fixing points deducted) e.g.
  * **style:** spaces were added before and after operators.
  * **fix count_votes algorithm:** fix count_votes algorithm by ...


## Real world context

* This will include your EdStem post about a particular topic.

## Submitting your Portfolio

* In google drive, we will create a portfolio folder with sub folders for each theme. Each folder should contain:

1. A zine: If you prefer to draw your zine, you can scan it and include it as a png or pdf.
2. Your polished hw, lab, or project
3. A document describing how your hw, lab, or project demonstrates a concept and a short summary of any updates you made to your hw, lab, or project based on feedback.
4. A document containing your EdStem post reflecting on real-world context (N.B. Only for particular sections)
