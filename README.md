# Introduction to Computing and Programming

This course explores computational thinking and problem solving via an introduction to computer programming. More specifically, the course explores computing as a discipline of study, discovering accurate solutions to interesting and challenging problems, and representing these solutions in a precise way so that computers can assist with solving the problems. Students learn fundamentals of programming using Python, including basic data structures, flow control structures, functions, recursion, elementary object-oriented programming, file I/O and discussion of higher-level concepts including abstraction, modularity, testing, and debugging. Through detailed laboratory and project work, these concepts are developed using important real-world contexts.

# Student GitHub instructions

## Overview
We will use the following tools in this course:
- [GitHub](https://www.github.com): used to download code and data, collaborate with other students, and submit course assignments
- [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/): a Google resource we will use to write code, download data, and run analyses

## Setup 
1. You will be using your COA google accounts for this course. Make sure you can sign into Colaboratory using [this link to colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. (Coming soon) Start by creating a free [GitHub account](https://www.github.com) if you don't already have one.  (If you already have an account, you may use it for this course.)

## Getting help
Learning to code can be a tricky, rewarding, and often frustrating business.  Luckily for us, there are many places to get help!  Examples include:
- [Google](https://www.google.com)-- searchable portal to of all human knowledge. Most Internet things are reachable through here, and it's a great place to start your search.  You can often find code that other people have written that solves a similar problem to the one you're working on, or a tutorial that teaches you how to solve a particular class of problems.
- [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/)-- community-curated encyclopedia. Wikipedia is a good resource for learning about the background of a technique, looking up equations, etc.  It's not a good source for tutorials.
- [Google Classroom Question Page]()-- course chatroom.  A good place to ask questions, post ideas, etc., to other members of the class and community.

- **Important**-- chances are good that if you're feeling lost, you're not the only one!  If you learn something useful, please share it via Google Classroom or by opening a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/LaurieLBaker/DCS-109/issues).

## Coming soon: Where to start

The [assignments README file](https://github.com/LaurieLBaker/DCS-109/) contains links to all course assignments and the associated source code.  We'll use [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/) to distribute assignments.  (You can log into GitHub Classroom with your GitHub credentials.)
